      <description><![CDATA["People who are rather more than six feet tall and nearly as broad across

behind rocks then say things like, "Oh. Sorry. I thought you were someone

      <description><![CDATA["The point that must be made is that although Herrena the Henna-Haired
Harridan would look quite stunning after a good bath, a heavy-duty
manicure, and the pick of the leather racks in Woo Hung Ling's Oriental
Exotica and Martial Aids on Heroes Street, she was currently quite sensibly
dressed in light chain mail, soft boots, and a short sword. All right,
maybe the boots were leather. But not black."<br><br> - Terry Pratchett, The Light Fantastic]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA["It was the sort of thing you expected in the Street of Alchemists. The
neighbours *preferred* explosions, which were at least identifiable and
soon over. They were better than the smells, which crept up on you."<br><br> - Terry Pratchett, Moving Pictures]]></description>
